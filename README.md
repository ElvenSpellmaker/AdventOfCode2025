Advent of Code 2025
===================

Overview
--------

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 written in, of course, PHP.

Requirements
------------

 - Eirctl (https://github.com/Ensono/eirctl)

NOTE: It's possible to run this using a local PHP 8.3 without eirctl, the tool
just helps as you don't have to have PHP installed to run the code.

Usage
-----

To run an example just run `eirctl day <day> <part>`, e.g. `eirctl day 1 2` to
run Day 1 Part 2

To get a shell to the context run `eirctl shell php8`

Linting
-------

To run YAML Linting, run `eirctl lint:yaml`
